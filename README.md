# Coophub - Cooperatives repos over the world!

:link: [`coophub.io`](http://coophub.io)

This web app uses the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) and [GitLab API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/README.html) to fetch, process and nicely display the projects/repositories of any subscribed cooperative from over the world.

Please note that it's strictly limited to cooperative enterprises.

The main goal is to gather in one place all the open source projects that can be used to start others, to be consumed, to learn or to just motivate collaboration.

## Add your cooperative
1. [Fork this repo](https://github.com/fiqus/coophub/fork) or edit this [file](https://github.com/fiqus/coophub/edit/master/cooperatives.yml)
2. Add your co-op in the [cooperatives.yml](https://github.com/fiqus/coophub/blob/master/cooperatives.yml) file:
```
key_org_name:
  source: github|gitlab|git.coop
  login: <USERNAME_IN_THE_SOURCE>
  name: <NAME_OF_THE_COOP>
  url: <URL_OF_THE_COOP>
  description: <DESCRIPTION>
  location: <LOCATION>
```
3. Add-commit-push and send us a Pull Request!

## Changelog
See [changelog file](CHANGELOG.md).

## Development

Use `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN` ENV var in order to authenticate with the GitHub APIv3. Read the [guide](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/getting-started/#oauth).

### With docker

If you want to set any environment, like `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN`, create a `.env` file with the custom values that you want.

Available environments:
| environment        | Default value |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN |               |
| VERSION_ELIXIR     | 1.14          |
| VERSION_NODE       | 18            |

* Clone this repository
* Run the command `docker compose up -d`

### Local
It uses the Elixir [Phoenix Framework](https://phoenixframework.org/) for the back-end and ReactJS for the front-end.
Then, to run this app you will need:
- Erlang OTP >= 18
- Elixir >= 1.5
- NodeJS >= 5.0

### Run it!
- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
- Start Phoenix server with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

  - Target: Always against `master` branch.
